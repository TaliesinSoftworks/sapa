> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.

__Alel sambam yaleln kalwa yu toke usulsi-turin.__

> Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, full of the ends of worms and an oozy smell,

__Yemur sambansam asasa, siata, turun, koy ramaren agalsokal pasumi dehansami koy uku adaileta,__

> nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole, with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat.

__koy yemur sambansam ataku, lulen, sayungta, koy irato yemur yalel eki ga torusuyada koy yemur aga kumuda.__

> It was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

__Eki yu yantas sambam usulsi-turinsam, koy rira mamatun tatada.__
